# TrueNAS Plugin Changelog

## Performance & Reliability Improvements (September 2025)

### 🚀 **Major Performance Optimizations**
- **93% faster volume deletion**: 2m24s → 10s by eliminating unnecessary re-login after deletion
- **API result caching**: 60-second TTL cache for static data (targets, extents, global config)
- **Smart iSCSI session management**: Skip redundant logins when sessions already exist
- **Optimized timeouts**: Reduced aggressive timeout values from 90s+60s to 30s+20s+15s

### ✅ **Error Elimination**
- **Fixed iSCSI session rescan errors**: Added smart session detection before rescan operations
- **Eliminated VM startup failures**: Fixed race condition by verifying device accessibility after volume creation
- **Removed debug logging**: Cleaned up temporary debug output

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- Added `_target_sessions_active()` function for intelligent session state detection
- Implemented automatic cache invalidation when extents/mappings are modified
- Enhanced device discovery with progressive retry logic (up to 10 seconds)
- Improved error handling with contextual information

### 📊 **Results**
- **Volume deletion**: 93% performance improvement
- **Volume creation**: Eliminated race condition causing VM startup failures
- **Error messages**: Removed spurious iSCSI rescan failure warnings
- **API efficiency**: Reduced redundant TrueNAS API calls through intelligent caching

### 🎯 **User Impact**
- **Administrators**: Dramatically faster storage operations with fewer error messages
- **Production environments**: More reliable VM management and storage workflows
- **Enterprise users**: Improved responsiveness and reduced operational friction
